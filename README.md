# Project: Dropouts

## Overview
This project includes implementations of neural network models for two different problems:
1. Predicting the price range of smartphones based on various features.
2. Classifying 2D points into different classes based on their coordinates.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tqdm

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/dropouts.git
   cd dropouts

Usage

    Navigate to the relevant directory for the problem you want to explore (smartphone_price_prediction or 2d_point_classification).

    Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the neural network models.

    Customize the models or experiment with hyperparameters as needed.
